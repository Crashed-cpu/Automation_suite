## üîÑ Integration with Automation Suite

This server is managed through the Automation Suite dashboard:

1. Navigate to "JavaScript Tools" > "Server Management"
2. Click on "üé• Video Email"
3. Use the control panel to start/stop the server
4. View real-time logs and server status

### Environment Variables in Automation Suite
When running in the Automation Suite, these environment variables are automatically managed:
- `PORT`: Assigned automatically to avoid conflicts
- `NODE_ENV`: Set based on the environment
- Logs are captured in the Automation Suite interface

## Security Notes

- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`
- For production use, consider:
  - Using environment variables directly on your hosting provider
  - Setting up proper SSL/TLS
  - Implementing rate limiting
  - Setting up proper file cleanup for uploaded videos

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Email Not Sending
1. **Symptom**: Emails are not being delivered
   - Verify Gmail App Password is correctly set up
   - Check server logs for authentication errors (look for "Invalid login" or similar)
   - Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google Account
   - Check if your account has exceeded daily sending limits

#### Server Not Starting
1. **Symptom**: Server fails to start
   - Check if the port is already in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :3003`
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check the error logs in the Automation Suite dashboard

#### Video Upload Issues
1. **Symptom**: Video uploads fail
   - Check if the upload directory has write permissions
   - Verify the file size is within the `MAX_FILE_SIZE` limit
   - Ensure the file format is in the allowed extensions
   - Check if there's enough disk space available

### Debugging

#### Enable Debug Logging
Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your `.env` file to get more detailed logs.

#### Check Server Logs
- In development: Logs appear in the console
- In production: Check the log file specified in `LOG_FILE`
- In Automation Suite: View logs in the server management interface

### Common Error Messages
- **"Invalid login"**: Check your Gmail App Password
- **"Port already in use"**: Change the `PORT` in `.env` or stop the conflicting service
- **"Request Entity Too Large"**: Increase `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in `.env`
- **"No file uploaded"**: Ensure you're sending the file in the correct form fields

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Secure Configuration
- Never commit `.env` to version control (it's in `.gitignore` by default)
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Keep your Gmail App Password secure and rotate it periodically
- Set appropriate file permissions on the upload directory

### Production Deployment
- Always run in production mode (`NODE_ENV=production`) in production
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Set up proper CORS policies if the API is accessed from different domains
- Consider using a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) in production
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches

### Rate Limiting
Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse:
```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 20 // limit each IP to 20 requests per windowMs
});

app.use('/api/upload', limiter);
```
